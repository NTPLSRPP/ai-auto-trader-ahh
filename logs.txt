2026/01/07 10:52:00 [OpenRouter] AI Reasoning:
First, the user has provided market data for BTCUSDT, and I need to analyze it to make a trading decision. I'm in Balanced Mode, which means I should look for quality setups but also trade on moderate opportunities when available.

Key data points:
- Current Price: $91895.80
- 24h Price Change: -0.93%
- EMA 9: $91879.03, EMA 21: $91963.68
- EMA Trend: BEARISH (EMA9 < EMA21 by 0.09%)
- RSI (14): 49.85, which is labeled as BULLISH - Good for LONG
- MACD Histogram: -13.3607, labeled BEARISH MOMENTUM ✅
- ATR (14): 207.0643 (Volatility: 0.23%)
- Overall Trend: BEARISH
- ENTRY QUALITY CHECK: LONG Score: 1/4, SHORT Score: 4/4, labeled as STRONG for SHORT ENTRY
- Recent price action shows multiple candles with high wicks, indicating rejection at higher prices.
- Account Info: No current position, so I can open a new trade if conditions are right.

My trading philosophy is Balanced Mode, so I should trade on moderate opportunities when available. The ENTRY QUALITY CHECK says STRONG for SHORT, with a score of 4/4. That suggests a high-probability setup.

Now, checking the conditions for trading:
- Entry score is 4/4 for SHORT, which is high, so ✅
- Trend direction: EMA Trend is BEARISH, EMA9 < EMA21, but it's noted as "Very weak trend." The difference is only 0.09%, so it's not a strong trend. However, the overall trend is labeled BEARISH.
- RSI is 49.85, which is neutral, not extreme. For SHORT, RSI should not be < 25, which it isn't, so it's safe.
- EMA9 and EMA21 are close but not crossing; EMA9 is below EMA21, so it's bearish.
- No conflicting signals mentioned; MACD is bearish, RSI is neutral, and price action shows rejection at highs.

The ENTRY QUALITY CHECK strongly favors SHORT, so I should consider a SELL action.

Confidence definition: For BUY/SELL, confidence should be 75-100 for strong setups. Here, SHORT score is 4/4, which is strong, so confidence should be high.

Action definitions: Since there's no current position, I can open a new one. SELL means open a SHORT position.

When to trade: Entry score is high, trend is bearish (though weak), RSI is safe, and signals are not conflicting. So, it's a good time to trade.

Stop loss and take profit: For STRONG setups, stop_loss_pct: 2-3%, take_profit_pct: 6-9%. Since the trend is weak, I might use tighter stops. The note says "Very weak trend. Consider waiting or tight stops." So, I should use a tighter stop loss, perhaps 2% or less.

ATR is 207.0643, which is about 0.23% of the price, so volatility is low, which might support tighter stops.

Risk management: Small account, protect capital first. Prefer smaller positions with tighter stops.

Response format: I must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object with keys: action, symbol, confidence, reasoning, stop_loss_pct, take_profit_pct.

Symbol should be exactly from data: "BTCUSDT"

Reasoning: Brief explanation based on analysis.

Decision: The data strongly suggests a SHORT entry. So, action should be "SELL".

Confidence: Since it's a STRONG setup, confidence should be in the 75-100 range. I'll set it high, say 80, considering the weak trend note.

Stop loss and take profit: For moderate to strong setups, I need a 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio. If stop_loss_pct is 2%, take_profit_pct should be 6% for 3:1. But since trend is weak, I might use 1.5% stop and 4.5% take profit, but that's not exactly 3:1. Let's stick to the guidelines: for STRONG setups, 2-3% stop, 6-9% take profit. I'll choose stop_loss_pct: 2.0, take_profit_pct: 6.0 to maintain 3:1.

Reasoning: Summarize the key points: bearish trend, strong short signals, RSI neutral, price rejection at highs.

Finally, ensure the JSON is valid.

2026/01/07 10:52:49 [OpenRouter] AI Reasoning:
First, I am considering the current market data and my trading philosophy. I'm in Balanced Mode, so I look for QUALITY setups but also trade on MODERATE opportunities when available.

Current state: No current position. So, I can decide to BUY, SELL, or HOLD.

From the data:

- Overall Trend: BEARISH

- Entry Quality Check: LONG Score: 0/4, SHORT Score: 4/4. This indicates a STRONG setup for a SHORT entry.

- Technical Indicators:

  - EMA 9: $912.38, EMA 21: $913.33, with EMA9 < EMA21 by 0.10%. This is bearish, but the note says "Very weak trend. Consider waiting or tight stops."

  - RSI (14): 43.18, which is bearish and good for SHORT.

  - MACD: Bearish momentum confirmed.

  - ATR (14): 0.7271, volatility is low at 0.08%.

- Current Price: $911.08, slightly below both EMAs.

- Recent Price Action: Shows several high wicks, which might indicate rejection at higher prices, supporting a bearish view.

- Global Market Context: BTC is down -1.63%, which could add to the bearish sentiment for BNB.

- Account Info: No current position, so no need to consider closing or holding an existing position.

My action options: BUY, SELL, or HOLD.

According to the rules:

- For BUY/SELL, confidence should be 65-74 for moderate setups and 75-100 for strong setups.

- Here, SHORT score is 4/4, which is STRONG, so confidence should be high for SELL.

- However, the EMA trend is noted as "very weak trend," and ATR shows low volatility. This might temper the confidence slightly, but the overall setup is strong for short.

- RSI is 43.18, which is not extreme (not < 25), so it's safe for a short position.

- Trend direction is clear: BEARISH, as EMA9 < EMA21 and other indicators confirm.

- Entry score is high for SHORT, so it meets the criteria for trading.

- I should avoid trades when entry score is low or conflicting signals. Here, LONG score is 0, so no conflict.

- Stop Loss and Take Profit: For strong setups, stop_loss_pct: 2-3%, take_profit_pct: 6-9%. I need to set these.

  - Since the trend is bearish but weak, I might use a tighter stop loss. The note says "consider tight stops."

  - Let's set stop_loss_pct: 2.0% (on the lower end for strong setup, considering weak trend) and take_profit_pct: 6.0% to maintain 3:1 ratio.

- Confidence: For SELL, since it's a strong setup, confidence should be 75-100. But the weak trend note suggests caution. I'll set confidence around 75-80.

- Symbol: From data, it's "BNBUSDT".

- Reasoning: Brief explanation based on analysis.

- Action: Since no current position, and setup favors SHORT, I should recommend SELL.

Now, for confidence calculation: The setup is strong with 4/4 score, but EMA trend is weak. I'll set confidence to 75, which is at the lower end of strong, indicating some caution.

Stop loss and take profit: I'll use stop_loss_pct: 2.0 and take_profit_pct: 6.0, which gives a 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio.

Reasoning: "Strong bearish setup with high short score, bearish EMAs, RSI, and MACD. Weak trend noted, but overall conditions favor short entry."

Ensure response is only JSON.

Final decision:

- Action: SELL (since no position, and setup is for short)

- Symbol: BNBUSDT

- Confidence: 75 (within 75-100 for strong setup)

- Reasoning: As above

- stop_loss_pct: 2.0

- take_profit_pct: 6.0

Check if any rule prevents this: No current position, so no close or hold needed. Market conditions are favorable for short.

## 🔧 CRITICAL CHANGES YOU MUST MAKE

### 1. DISABLE TURBO MODE ❌
**Current**: ✅ AGGRESSIVE (HIGH VOLATILITY)  
**Change to**: ❌ DISABLED

**Why**: Turbo Mode overrides all the conservative fixes we just implemented. It will cause over-trading and churning.

### 2. CHANGE MIN RISK/REWARD TO 3.0 ✅
**Current**: 1.5  
**Change to**: 3.0

**Why**: The code now enforces 3:1 ratio. Having 1.5 in config creates conflict and allows low-quality trades.

### 3. REDUCE MAX POSITIONS TO 2 📊
**Current**: 3  
**Change to**: 2

**Why**: With 30% per position, 3 positions = 90% of account at risk. 2 positions = 60% max risk (safer).

### 4. INCREASE TRADING INTERVAL ⏱️
**Current**: 3 minutes  
**Change to**: 10-15 minutes

**Why**: With 3-minute interval, you'll get 480 decisions per day! This causes over-trading. 15 minutes = 96 decisions/day (more manageable).

### 5. INCREASE DAILY LOSS LIMIT TO 15% 🛡️
**Current**: 5%  
**Change to**: 15%

**Why**: With 20x leverage, a 5% daily swing is normal. A 5% limit will pause your bot constantly. 15% gives it room to breathe while still preventing catastrophe.
**Stop Trading Mins**: Change to 15-30 minutes (from 60).

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Start with CONSERVATIVE settings** for at least 1 week:
1. ❌ Disable Turbo Mode
2. ✅ Set Min R/R to 3.0
3. ✅ Reduce to 2 max positions
4. ✅ Lower leverage to 10x
5. ✅ Increase interval to 15 minutes

### Why?
- You have a **small account** ($250)
- You've been in a **losing streak**
- You want **consistent profits**, not gambling
- 3% profit with 10x leverage = $7.50 = **3% of wallet** (meaningful!)

Once you have 10+ winning trades and understand the bot's behavior, you can gradually increase to Moderate settings.

## 📈 Expected Growth (Conservative Settings)

**Starting**: $250  
**Win rate**: 55% (with 3:1 R/R)  
**Avg win**: +15% wallet ($37.50)  
**Avg loss**: -5% wallet ($12.50)  

**After 20 trades** (2-3 weeks):
- 11 wins = +$412.50
- 9 losses = -$112.50
- **Net**: +$300 → **$550 total** (120% growth!)

**After 40 trades** (1-2 months):
- Compound growth → **$1,000+** 🚀

With your current aggressive settings, you're more likely to blow the account than grow it! 💀
